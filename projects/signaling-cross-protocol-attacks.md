# Signaling Cross-Protocol Attacks

## Overview
Research on cross-protocol attacks involving SS7, Diameter, and SIP signaling. The project investigates how attackers can exploit protocol interactions and weaknesses across telecom signaling systems.

## Status
- Ongoing

## Lead(s)
- TelcoSec Research Team

## Objectives
